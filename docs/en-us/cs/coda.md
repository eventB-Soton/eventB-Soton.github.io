# CODA Component Diagram models

CODA is a component modelling approach for rigorous hardware design, which has been developed at Southampton in collaboration with UK industry.

CODA includes a new kind of diagram that integrates with the UML-B tool suite. CODA provides an environment for modelling hierarchical components that communicate via timed channels.

The internal behaviour of the component can be modelled using embedded UML-B state-machines. The state-machine transitions can control, or be triggered by, the component’s port operations.

CODA also has a mechanism for decomposition so that complex models can be managed as a collection of independently refined and verified component models.

CODA integrates with hardware design automation flows through capabilities for generating VHDL hardware descriptions from CODA component models. The CODA tool suite is released open-source alongside the UML-B diagrammatic modelling tools.
